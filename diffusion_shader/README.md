# reaction diffusion 

Press-and-hold mouse to 'add particles/liquid'. Run in Tweak mode to play adjust values. 

Much help taken from [here](https://forum.processing.org/two/discussion/22385/reaction-diffusion-using-glsl-works-different-from-normal). Seems to be some floating point precision issues with this implementation as well - renders different than CPU.

Todo:
- more colour options
- allow for variable step size? 
- try with three.js
- gui controls
- option to specify/modify kernel?
